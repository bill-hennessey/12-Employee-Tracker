# 12-Employee-Tracker

## Description

This is a command line type application that guides the user through personnel-related tasks that interacts with the backend mysql database. This was a challenging project that broght several skills together. I was unable to complete the project, mainly because I spent the first few days building the app in a way that is not specified in the readme. Once I figured that out, I worked all day to try and do it right but in the end I failed. I am extremely frustrated that I once again was unable to complete the task. I am sorry that this readme is turning into a journal entry but I am exhausted and dripping in failure.

## Installation

Nothing to install. Navigate to the home directory, install the required dependencies with npm install, and run node server.js.

## Usage

Use the arrow keys to select the task. Type in the answers to the questions and the database will update auatomatically... if its finished that is.
